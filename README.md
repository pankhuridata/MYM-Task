# MYM-Tasks for Data Analyst Intern
This assessment aims to assess your ability to work with data sets, perform data analysis, cleansing, and transformation, and derive meaningful insights from data. Please complete the following tasks:

## Task 1: Data Analysis and Insights Generation

Instructions:
1. Obtain a real-world dataset related to a specific domain (e.g., sales, marketing, customer behavior).
2. Perform exploratory data analysis using appropriate tools (Python, R, data visualization platforms).
3. Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
4. Conduct statistical analysis, applying measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients.
5. Apply advanced analytical methods (regression analysis, clustering) to identify patterns and trends.
6. Use data visualization techniques to present findings effectively (charts, graphs).
7. Interpret results, providing actionable insights and recommendations aligned with business objectives.
8. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis approach, key findings, and recommendations.

## Task 2: Data Cleansing and Transformation

Instructions:
1. Acquire a real-world dataset requiring data cleaning and transformation.
2. Address data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formats, outliers).
3. Develop a cleaning strategy (imputation, outlier detection, normalization).
4. Implement necessary transformation steps (feature engineering, aggregation).
5. Validate the cleaned and transformed dataset for integrity and usability.
6. Document the steps taken and provide clear explanations.
7. Present the cleaned and transformed dataset for further analysis.

## Task 3: Data-driven Insights and Reporting

Instructions:
